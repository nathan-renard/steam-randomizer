# Steam Randomizer Any%

This is the solution to all your problems when deciding between spending more money on the next Steam sale or finally playing the games you bought months (let's be honest, years) ago. With one simple application, you can log in to your Steam account and let this amazing app choose your next game from your least-played ones. By "least," I meant either the top 25 below 10 hours, or, to be even more honest, the ones that are still sitting at Zero.
